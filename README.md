# UmichSIM_Pragmatics
Place to learn how to better cooperate for coding tasks.

## Introduction
This repo contains tutorials on some basic tools that you will use intensively in our project. The name comes from [EECS201](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs201/wn2022/), which contains a more comprehensive version of these tutorials (highly recommend taking this course).

## Shells
### Obtaining a Unix Shell
#### Windows
Natively, Windows use another type of shell called CMD/PowerShell. Fortunately, with the help of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), it's easy to access a linux shell within the subsystem. Check [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install WSL.

#### macOS&Linux
Belonging to the family of "Unix Like" operating systems, macOS and Linux supports Unix Shell natively. Just open a terminal software (like Terminal.app on MacOS) and you are ready to go.

### first to remember
+ basic shell command structure

+ [TAB] - the most important key you need
  + helps complete your unfinished command or path
  + can even list available candidates

### Surfing in the file system
+ `pwd`
  + print working directory associated with your shell session
+ `cd`
  + change directory
  + usage: `cd /place/you/want`
  + `cd ..` will take you to the parent directory
+ `ls`
  + list contents in current directory
  + some options:
    + `-l`: display in list format
    + `-a`: also show hidden files (file start with `.`)

### Other useful commands and keys
+ `man`: see manual for commands
+ `ctrl`+`r`: search command history in bash
+ `ctrl`+`l`: `clear` the screen
+ `ctrl`+`d`: send EOF, can be used to close the current shell program
